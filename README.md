This dashboard is created by the use of Power bi. The visualization gives us insights of relations between different datasets. 	
The dashboard I have created is using database of a survey conducted. The visualization created shows the power of Power bi that 	
how it can transform data into such valuable insights. The database contains answer to the questions which contains	
the number of survey takers, their occupation, salary, gender, education, favorite programming language, etc. Power Bi is used to	
know the average number of survey takers, their satisfaction with work/life, satisfaction with salary, etc.
